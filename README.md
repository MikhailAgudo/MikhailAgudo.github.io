# MikhailAgudo.github.io
This is the repository for a personal website where my resume and work-related information will be at. There'll also be some content for other things that I like doing.

## Why This Project Exists
It's to showcase what I am capable of making. I'll be adding new projects as time goes by, mainly in JavaScript/HTML/CSS. Occasionally there might be projects for C#, Python 3 and GDScript.

## Running the Project Locally
Everything that's needed is in the `/docs` folder. Open `index.html` in a browser and the website will fire up. You may also individually open the .html files within the folders that contain projects.

## Editing the .js File
`main.js` is a bundled JavaScript file made by webpack (Node.js module). All of the code you see in `main.js` is in the `/src` folder.
