# Tic Tac Toe
This is based on [the Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/lessons/tic-tac-toe-javascript).

The goal of this project is to make a decent back-end for playing Tic Tac Toe.

## Usage
Click on the buttons to play. Whether the input is "1" or "2" depends on whose turn it is. Refresh the page to restart the game.
